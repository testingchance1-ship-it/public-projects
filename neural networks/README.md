Currently building my own Neural Networks

ai.py is specifically targeted towards the Attack_Dataset.csv that i grabbed from keggle or kaggle(however you spell it).
It only have a 50% success rate, will work on the weights and fine tuning that to be more accurate

the generic_learning script *should* work on most csv formats with a decent amount of luck, more tweaking will surely come.
